üõ°Ô∏è AI Phishing Email Detector
An intelligent automation agent that uses AI vision models to detect and delete phishing emails from your Gmail spam folder. The agent analyzes email screenshots using advanced reasoning models to identify sophisticated phishing attempts.
‚ú® Features

ü§ñ Automated Detection: AI-powered analysis of email content
üéØ High Accuracy: Detects domain typosquatting, credential harvesting, and brand impersonation
üîí Safe Operation: Only processes emails already in spam folder
üì∏ Visual Analysis: Screenshot-based detection catches visual phishing tricks
üîç Detailed Reasoning: Provides explanation for each decision
‚ö° Background Operation: Works independently while you continue other tasks

üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites

Windows 10/11
Python 3.8+
NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM (recommended) or CPU
Google Chrome browser

Installation

Install Python dependencies:

bashpip install selenium transformers torch pillow qwen-vl-utils accelerate

Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch (for GPU acceleration):

bashpip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

Clone the repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-phishing-detector
cd ai-phishing-detector
Setup Chrome for Remote Debugging
Step 1: Close all Chrome windows
powershelltaskkill /F /IM chrome.exe /T
Step 2: Wait a moment
powershellStart-Sleep -Seconds 3
Step 3: Start Chrome with debugging enabled
powershell& "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\chrome-debug"

Note: The --user-data-dir flag creates a separate Chrome profile for automation.

Step 4: Verify Chrome is ready
You should see:

A new Chrome window opens
Message: "Chrome is being controlled by automated test software"
Login to Gmail in this window

Step 5: Verify debugging port is open
powershellnetstat -an | Select-String "9222"
Expected output:
TCP    127.0.0.1:9222         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
Running the Detector
bashpython simple_phishing_detector.py
The agent will:

Load the AI model (first run downloads ~4GB)
Connect to your Chrome session
Navigate to your spam folder
Process each email automatically

While it runs, you can:

‚úÖ Continue working in other applications
‚úÖ Browse in a different Chrome window
‚úÖ The agent works independently in the background

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Edit simple_phishing_detector.py to adjust settings:
python# Confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
# Higher = fewer false positives, might miss some phishing
# Lower = catches more phishing, more false positives
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.75  # Default: 75%

# Screenshot directory
SCREENSHOT_DIR = "./phishing_screenshots"
üß† How It Works

Opens Email: Clicks each email in spam folder
Captures Screenshot: Takes full-page screenshot of email content
AI Analysis: Qwen2-VL reasoning model analyzes:

Domain typosquatting (paypa1.com vs paypal.com)
Credential harvesting attempts
Urgent/threatening language
Brand impersonation
Suspicious links and buttons


Decision: Makes DELETE or KEEP decision with confidence score
Action: Automatically executes the decision
Repeat: Moves to next email

üìù Example Output
EMAIL 1/5
From: security@paypa1.com
Subject: Urgent: Account Suspended

Analysis Result:
  Phishing: True
  Confidence: 95%
  Reasoning: Domain typosquatting detected (paypa1.com), 
             urgent language, credential request form

ACTION: DELETE (phishing detected)
  ‚úì Located email in list
  ‚úì Clicked Delete
  ‚úÖ Email deleted permanently
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
False Positives
The 2B model may occasionally mark legitimate emails as phishing (~10-20% rate). To reduce false positives:

Increase confidence threshold: Set to 0.85 or 0.90
Use larger model: Qwen2-VL-7B (requires 16GB GPU)
Use API-based alternatives: Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek v3

API Alternatives
Don't have a GPU? Use these API-based reasoning models:

Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google): Free tier available
DeepSeek v3 (DeepSeek): Open-source, affordable
GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI): High accuracy, paid

Replace the analyze_with_local_model() function with API calls.
Security

‚úÖ The agent only works on emails already marked as spam
‚úÖ It never touches your inbox directly
‚úÖ All processing happens locally (for local model)
‚úÖ Screenshots saved for audit trail

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Chrome connection fails
Error: No browser contexts found
Solution: Make sure Chrome is running with debugging enabled (see Setup step 3)
Model won't load
Error: CUDA out of memory
Solution: Your GPU doesn't have enough VRAM. Either:

Use CPU mode (slower but works)
Close other GPU-intensive applications
Use a smaller model

No emails detected
Error: Found 0 emails
Solution:

Verify you're logged into Gmail
Check that you're viewing the spam folder
Ensure you have emails in spam
